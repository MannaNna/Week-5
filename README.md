# Week-5
05-timers

In this unit, youâ€™ll review JavaScript and jQuery fundamentals, touch on timing events, the debugger, and sample interview questions.

You will also dive into JavaScript timing functions which are used everywhere in applications, from the alarm clock on your phone, to the countdown timer on your microwave.

Since it's never too early to hone your technical interview skills, you will start practicing for technical coding interviews. Even if you're not looking for a new job, being able to visualize problems,
articulate your thought process, and come to a solution will make you a better developer.
